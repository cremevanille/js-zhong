## General

Better Design???


darkmode?
github action to build on push (+ replace "/" by "/zhong/")

global sass? (like pug)
how many output scss files?

take a look a Performance

CSS ?? mode vs. Immediate mode
Javascript ?? mode vs. Svelte Declarative mode
HTML Hierarchical structure vs. ?? ?? ??

## Study

infer vocabulary group from dictionary then:
  pinyin -> characters?
  character (+ def) -> pinyin (+ def)
  def (+ pinyin) -> character (+ pinyin)
count points, store scores in localStorage

## Yinxixue

_build.js uses dictionary.js instead of ZhHans

"pinyin search..." -> chinese?

audio clips
汉子 -> 汉子例
display navigation

Javascript framework would greatly simpify the script:
reactive state:
- no need to check finals blabla when clicking on initials
- the current state is always correct

## Bushou

pronunciation (phonetics vs. meaning)
decomposition errors in dictionary.js...
- ZhHans: 阜 vs. 邑 / 月 vs. ⺼ (肉) / ⺫ (目) vs. 罒 (网) / 告: 𠂒 vs. ⺧ / 粲: 𣦼 vs. 歺
radicals vs. components vs. strokes

try: script to find all radicals/components in dictionaryZhHans.txt and compare

## Cihai

List is bugged
better display (animCJK?)
